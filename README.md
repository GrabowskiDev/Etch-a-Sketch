# Etch-a-Sketch

Starting grid is 16x16 blocks. You can make grid of any size! Just press the button "Make a new grid", and enter a number of columns!

To pick a color, type HEX value into the box, and press enter.

Color mesh will be created from any color! However, it will be just rainbow for grayish colors (but it still looks cool).

After selecting color, just hover over blocks to start painting them!

"Etch-a-Sketch" header will have gradient created based on given color.
